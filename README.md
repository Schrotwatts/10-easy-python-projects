Hello guys
I would recommend the users to have jupyter notebook installed, it is just a bit easier
You can go with vscode or any other tools too
ALso i will be attaching my youtube video for this, which you can refer to for step by step guide

> Notepad creator
1. pip install tkinter

> Weather Reader
1. pip install pyttsx3
2. generating API key on weatherapi.com
3. BASH_URL can be taken fromt the same page

> QR CODE GENERATOR
1. pip install qrcode
2. pip install pillow
3. pip install PIL

you can run the pip install on "command prompt" or on jupyter notebook as "!pip install xxx"
